# SDSSDepth: Self-Distillation via Prediction Consistency for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation

[comment]: <> (TODO: Add a demo image)

SDSSDepth is a codebase that implements the paper **Self-Distilled Self-Supervised Depth Estimation in Monocular Videos** that will be published at [ICPRAI](https://icprai2022.sciencesconf.org/)
. Also, we hope this codebase could support future research in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and beyond.
