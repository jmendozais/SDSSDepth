# SDSSDepth: Self-Distillation via Prediction Consistency for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation

[comment]: <> (TODO: Add a demo image)

SDSSDepth is a codebase that implements the paper **Self-Distilled Self-Supervised Depth Estimation in Monocular Videos** that will be published at <a link="https://icprai2022.sciencesconf.org/"> 	
ICPRAI 2022 </a>. Also, we hope this codebase could support future research in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and beyond.
